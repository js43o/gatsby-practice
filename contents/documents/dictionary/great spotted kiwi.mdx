This large kiwi is one of five species of kiwis residing in New Zealand. The other four are the tokoeka (Apteryx australis), Okarito brown kiwi (Apteryx rowi), little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii),[4] and North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli).[5] Great spotted kiwis are most closely related to the little spotted kiwi.[6] The kiwi genus, Apteryx, is endemic to New Zealand; 44% of the bird species native to New Zealand are endemic.[4] Kiwis are placed in the ratite family, which also includes the emu, ostrich, rhea,[7] and cassowary, as well as the extinct moa of New Zealand and elephant birds of Madagascar. All ratites are flightless.[8] While it was long presumed that kiwi were closely related to moa, recent DNA research identified elephant birds as kiwi's closest relatives. Additionally, kiwi are more closely related to emus and cassowaries than to moa; the latter are actually closest to the weakly flying tinamous of South America.[9]

Relationships in the genus Apteryx[6]

Before the great spotted kiwi was known to science, several stories circulated about the existence of a large kiwi called the Maori roaroa. In 1871, two specimens were brought to the Canterbury Museum, where they were identified as a new species and were named after the museum's curator, Dr. Haast.[10]

The great spotted kiwi was first described as Apteryx haastii by Thomas Potts, in 1872, based on a specimen from Westland, New Zealand.[2] It is a monotypic species.[11]

The genus name, Apteryx, comes from the Ancient Greek words a "without" or "no", and pteryx, "wing" and haasti is the Latin form of the last name of Sir Julius von Haast.[12][13]

Great spotted kiwis are the largest of the kiwis;[6] the male is 45 cm (18 in) tall, while the female is 50 cm (20 in) tall. Bill length ranges from 9 to 12 cm (3.5–4.7 in),[14] while weight ranges between 1.2 and 2.6 kg (2.6 and 5.7 lb) for males and 1.5 and 3.3 kg (3.3 and 7.3 lb) for females.[2] The body is pear-shaped, while the head and neck is small with a long slender ivory bill.[14][15] The great spotted kiwi, along with the other kiwi species, is the only bird with nostrils at the end of its bill.[16] The eyes are small and do not see well,[17] as it relies mostly on its sense of smell.[18] The legs are short, with three toes per foot.[17] It has a plumage composed of soft, hair-like feathers, which have no aftershafts. The plumage can range from charcoal grey to light brown.[14] They have large vibrissae around the gape, and they have no tail, only a small pygostyle.[2] The common name of this bird comes from black spots on its feathers.[17] They use their powerful legs and claws for defence against predators like stoats or ferrets. Kiwis are flightless birds, and hence lack hollow bones, lack a keel to which wing muscles anchor, and have tiny wings.[14] This species also has a low body temperature compared to other birds. Average lifespan is 30 to 40 years.[19]
