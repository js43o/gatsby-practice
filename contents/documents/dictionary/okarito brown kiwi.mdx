The Okarito kiwi (Apteryx rowi), also known as the rowi or Okarito brown kiwi, is a member of the kiwi family Apterygidae, described as new to science in 2003.[3] The species is part of the brown kiwi complex, and is morphologically very similar to other members of that complex. It is found in a restricted area of the Ōkārito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island,[4] and has a population of about only 600 birds.[5

The Okarito kiwi is a monotypic species, i.e. there are no recognised subspecies.[4] The genus name Apteryx stems from the Greek "without wings".[6] Originally assumed to be the same species as the Southern brown kiwi A. australis, DNA testing shows that the possible split off from this species was 8.2 million years ago, and the split from their closest relatives, the Northern Island brown kiwi A. mantelli was around 6.2 million years ago.[7] This bird is a ratite and has similarities to the others (emu, ostrich, rhea, cassowary). Its sternum has no keel, its wings are minimal, and it has no preen gland. Its palate is also distinctive, and its feathers have no barbules or aftershaft. Other features that are similar to only the other kiwi is a weak gizzard and no tail, only a pygostyle.[8]

The Okarito brown kiwi lives in the Okarito forest on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island.[4][9] On 29 June 2010, three breeding pairs were released onto Blumine Island as part of a breeding programme.[10] A new population was established in the Omoeroa Ranges near Fox Glacier in late 2018.[11]
